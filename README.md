# Unix Timestamp Builder

This is a small webapp to create and parse Unix timestamps in different timezones. Compared to the other similar things on Google's first page results, this is much simpler to use and fits the purpose better.

## Demo

A demo of the application is [available here](https://stuff.shubhamjain.co/unix-timestamp-builder/).

### Build

To build on your computer â€”

 * Install Node packages with `npm install`.
 * Install Grunt task runner with `npm install -g grunt`.
 * Run `grunt watch` to monitor files and trigger the build process when something is changed.
